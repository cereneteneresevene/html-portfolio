<h1>The Best Movies According to Ceren</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies this year.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Elemental</h3>
<p>Elemental: Forces of Nature tells the story of the inhabitants of Element City, the elements of fire, water, earth, and air. 
Alev, a quick-witted, fiery young woman, and the emotional Deniz, who lives in the flow of life, are two friends living in Elemental City. 
The bond between them changes Amber's view of the world they live in. 
Two opposite poles of fire and water find themselves in a challenging adventure.</p>
<h3>Spider Man:Across The Spider Verse</h3>
<p>
I got the feeling of Avengers, one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen in my life, but it's a completely different dimension spider universe. 
I can't wait for movie 3
</p>
<h3>Dog Gone</h3>
<p>The movie is more about finding the dog and family ties to it than a dog movie. 
Although it is not a very high quality production. 
It is always enjoyable to watch our little friends.
